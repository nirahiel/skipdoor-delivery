	<description><![CDATA[A patch for the skipdoor psycast from the Vanilla Psycasts Expanded mod.

With this mod, skipdoors can teleport items to other skipdoors automatically, even if they are in different maps. You can use skipdoors to send your hard-earned loot back to your base, to move items around your colony, or even to help manage simultaneous colonies.

<b>How does it work?</b>

After creating your skipdoors, you must place a stockpile zone under each skipdoor that needs to send or receive items. The configuration of these stockpile zones is used by the skipdoors to choose which items to send, and where they should be sent.

Skipdoors will only send things to skipdoors with a higher stockpile zone priority than themselves, and only if the filter of the target accepts the item being sent. They will always prefer sending items to the destination with the highest priority.

Skipdoors will only attempt to teleport things in a 5x5 area around itself. You can see this area in-game when you select a skipdoor. To be teleported, things must also be inside the same stockpile zone as the origin skipdoor, or they must not be in any stockpile zone. Skipdoors will never teleport items stored inside a storage building.

When things are teleported, they are placed in the stockpile zone of the chosen destination skipdoor, without a distance limit. This means that no items will be teleported if the stockpile zone has no remaining space, but also that you can make the zone as large as you need.
